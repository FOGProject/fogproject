Overview
--------

FOG is an Open-Source computer imaging solution.  It currently works with Windows XP,
 Windows Vista, and Linux (Beta).  FOG ties together many open-source 
applications and adds a web interface to manage everything.  

Installation
------------

The installer will only work correctly on Fedora/Red Hat (and maybe Centos) or Ubuntu.  
It has only been tested on Fedora 7, 8, 9, Ubuntu 7.10, & 8.04.

Fedora 7, 8, 9:
 * firewall disabled 
 * selinux disabled
 * default packages
 * static IP v4 address
