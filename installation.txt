Overview
--------

       FOG is an Open-Source computer imaging solution. It currently works with
	Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10,
        and Linux ext 2,3,4 (resizable) and LVM layouts (non-resizable).
	FOG ties together many open-source applications and adds a web
	interface to manage everything.

------------

The installer works correctly on:
	Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04
	CentOS 7 (assumed RHEL of same versions)
	Fedora 25

 ** cd into the bin directory and run ./installfog.sh

 * After updating the schema, come back to the installer and press [ENTER] to continue.


Client Setup
------------

* The FOG Client can be downloaded from anywhere in the FOG web interface by navigating to:
** http://x.x.x.x/fog/management
* Look at the bottom of any page (even the login page) you will see "FOG Client" that will take you to the available options.
* It's highly recommended to use the new FOG Client, as the legacy client's support will eventually be dropped.
* When using the new fog client, FOGCrypt should not be used.
* FOG Prep is obsolete, it was designed for Windows XP. 
* FOG Does not require that images are sysprepped, but you might require this. Up to you.
