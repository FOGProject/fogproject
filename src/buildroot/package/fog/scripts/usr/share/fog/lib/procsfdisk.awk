# This script will shrink (resize) partitions based
#  on the new partition size passed in.
# NOTE: This does not shrink the volume,
#  just the parititon layout information.
# This script will fill disks (expand) with
#  the relevant data passed on based on the disk size passed in.
#
# Usage Passed in Variables:
#
# SECTOR_SIZE The default sector size. Currently set to 512
# CHUNK_SIZE  The default block size for the disk/partition being used. Typically 512
# MIN_START   The minimum start position for the first partition. Typically 2048.
# action      The action to perform with the script.
#  1. filldisk Fills the disk.
#  2. move     Moves partitions.
#  3. resize   Shrinks partitions.
# target      The target to work with.
#  1. filldisk The target is the disk in whole.
#  2. move     The target is the current partition.
#  3. resize   The target is the current partition.
# sizePos     The size to change.
#  This is only used for move/resize. Used to tell
#   the new size of the disk.
# diskSize    The disk size.
# fixedList   The partition sizes that should remain untouched in size.
