Version 1.3.X
-------------
* Move multicast interface setter to the storage nodes rather than a single
global value that may not be accurate.
* Use new awk setup thats cleaner and integrated with sfdisk that supports gpt
* Fix bug where snapintasks if generated after main tasking and before that
tasking is created, get closed and not properly closing the actual deployed
task.
* Fix servicemodule-active so it properly supports the new names and the old
names.
* Fix proxy information to NOT proxy storage node internalized Storage Node
information.
* Fix multicast issues for all relevant systems. Thank you Curtis.
* Fix snapins operate only if the host has snapins.
* Fix size display of images on server to display proper sizes through the use
of rawlist.
* Fix multicast session joining feature so the registered host will work with
non assigned images.
* Fix resizable imaging to take start sector from the file rather than making
assumptions of the start sector.
* Fix compatibility issues of Windows XP/Vista imaging in 1.2.0.
* Fix compatibility issues of 0.32 Images particularly in the re-uploading to
operate with partclone.  Most of this is related to the start sector of 63 but
assumed start sectors were starting at 2048.  Hopefully this is all good now.
* Move clamav off of server to static binaries.  Bumps size of installer
folder from 80MB to 277MB.  However clamav is not loaded in the initrd file
and this same clamav can operate on the fog server.
* Move kernels and inits out of SVN and download during installer.
* Init's should initialize any disk now.
* All resizable images will now upload with a common means of d1px.img rather
than sys.img.000 or imagename as a file.
* Make compatibility checks to allow older named images to still download.
* Change mac address and associations so they are all stored in a single
table.
* Change resizable images to all use the same principle of Linux resizable.
This should allow OEM built systems to be imaged even with resizable.
* Change the version in inits banner to come from the GUI.
* Init's are now truly native with dns pulling.
* Added to inits to check for has_usb_nic flag which simply tells the system
to wait for the user to unplug and replug their usb nics.
* Update init.xz/init_32.xz to 2015.05 and update kernel infos to 4.0.4
within the inits
* Add memory limit, timezone setting, and post_max_size, max_upload_size to be
pulled from the database rather than from the php.ini setting
* Add multicast port override, as needed.  Add capability to specify the
multicast address as well.
* Add FTP enable/disable for server sizes of images.
* Add elements to allow mass deletion of items from relevant management pages.
* Add jquery to read log files.
* Add Apache error and access logs to the log viewer elements.
* Add capability to only filter logs if they exist.
* Add jquery script to allow quickreg_img_id to dynamically update the os for
the selected image.
* Add protection flag to image files.
* Add installer files from David Fear to fog to allow FOG Installation on
Arch Linux.
* Add partition imaging selection options into GUI and fog to operate within.
* Add ipxe support for Apple EFI and better generalized EFI support.  Special
thanks to Michael Brown, the iPXE team, and Curtis Larsen for taking the time
to debug and correct and make this work.
* Add ipxeTable element to read the ipxe file and information to let us get
some kind of database of known working/troublesome systems.
* Add support for Apple Mac OS support in our systems.
* Add initial support for torrent casting.  Only works for resizable.
* Adjust bootmenu to store to variables.  This can then allow hooks to
interact with the boot menu setup for customizations as needed.
* Adjust the menu items to go into database to allow adding own custom
options that stay even if updated.
* Add ability to customize iPXE Menu items besides our main defaults. May
think about allowing editing but for now we'll just try the adding custom
entries.  The first twelve items are only editable to be adjusted by default
item or what menu they display in.
* Inject the Boot Items into HookManager by means of array push.  This should
allow the items to be edited using variables for each menu item as a hook to
the event of: BOOT_ITEMS_<titlename>  Replacing titlename to stuff like:
fog_local or fog_advanced.  The period is replaced with an _ to ensure
compatibility.
* Add example hook for BootItem information adjustments in a hook format.
* Add imageid to task table.  Will be useful for quick, multicast join, etc.
* Add imageGroupAssoc table to allow images to be assigned to multiple groups.
This is useful to assign images across groups and have replicator handle them.
* Move many of the location plugin in the core code to work from hooks
directly purely from the plugin.
* Add WOL broadcast address plugin.  This simply tells the fog server where to
send wol broadcasts and is useful in the case of vlans where you don't control
your own network.
* Add snapin/image replication to work group->group as well as the normal.
* Add replication to allow multiple processes at the same time.
* Add bandwidth limitations on replication.
* Add capability to tell the system which tasks you want to take slots.
* Add multicast session joining even with non-registered hosts.
* Change names of PXE Menu stuff to iPXE stuff.
* Make a strong move for async methodologies.
* Ultimately make the Host class a little more in line with DRY.

used and should never have been used to getin with.  It now uses the -1s
method to specify to the end of the disk.
* Add ftp file size checking.  All sizes are done through ftp now.
* Add size of byte filtering to get pretty size.
* Add $this->FOGUser to FOGPageManager and Hook to check if its set. This is
needed because FOGBase is loaded before FOGUser is actually established.

* Add SnapinJob to Host class.

the start of the hard-drive. Thanks Curtis
