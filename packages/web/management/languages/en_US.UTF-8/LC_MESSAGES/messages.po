#~ "Preamble\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software "
#~ "and other kinds of works.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to "
#~ "take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the "
#~ "GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share "
#~ "and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free "
#~ "software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU "
#~ "General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any "
#~ "other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your "
#~ "programs, too.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. "
#~ "Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the "
#~ "freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you "
#~ "wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that "
#~ "you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and "
#~ "that you know you can do these things.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these "
#~ "rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain "
#~ "responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you "
#~ "modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis "
#~ "or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that "
#~ "you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the "
#~ "source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their "
#~ "rights.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) "
#~ "assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving "
#~ "you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains "
#~ "that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and "
#~ "authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as "
#~ "changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to "
#~ "authors of previous versions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified "
#~ "versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do "
#~ "so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' "
#~ "freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse "
#~ "occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely "
#~ "where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version "
#~ "of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems "
#~ "arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this "
#~ "provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to "
#~ "protect the freedom of users.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. "
#~ "States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of "
#~ "software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to "
#~ "avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could "
#~ "make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that "
#~ "patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n"
