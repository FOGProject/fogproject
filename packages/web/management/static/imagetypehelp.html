		<h3>Image Type Information</h3>
		
		<h5>Single Partition</h5>
		<p>Single Partition partition images are support only a single NTFS partitions.  These partitions are resizable, meaning that an image from a 200GB hard disk can be put on a 10GB hard disk as long as the data is less than 10GB.  This image type is destructive, which means that your partitions will be modified, and it is possible if the task doesn't finish without error that your computer may not be bootable.</p>
		
		<h6>Overview</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Recommended Method</li>
			<li>Most Flexible</li>
			<li>NTFS Only!</li>
			<li>Destructive!</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h5>Multiple Partition - Single Disk</h5>
		<p>Multiple Partition - Single Disk will back up all the supported partitions on the first disk drive detected by FOG, but the partitions are NOT resizable by FOG.  This means that the image must be restored to a disk of the same or larger capacity.</p>
		
		<h6>Overview</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Single Disk Drive</li>
			<li>Not Resizable</li>
			<li>Supports: <strong>NTFS, XFS. JFS, HPFS, FAT16, FAT32, Reiser3, EXT2, EXT3</strong></li>
			<li>Linux Support!</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Multiple Partition - All Disks</h5>
		<p>Multiple Partition - All Disks will back up all the supported partitions on all disk drives detected by FOG, but the partitions are NOT resizable by FOG.  This means that the image must be restored to a disk of the same or larger capacity.</p>
		
		<h6>Overview</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>All Disk Drives</li>
			<li>Not Resizable</li>
			<li>Supports: <strong>NTFS, XFS. JFS, HPFS, FAT16, FAT32, Reiser3, EXT2, EXT3</strong></li>
			<li>Linux Support!</li>
		</ul>		
		
		<h5>Raw Image</h5>
		<p>Raw Image will do a raw sector-by-sector copy of your hard disk, which means that if you have a 80GB hard drive, dd will process 80BG of data, and you will end up with a <strong>VERY LARGE</strong> image that is <strong>VERY SLOW</strong> to create and restore.</p>		
		
		<h6>Overview</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Single Drive</li>
			<li>Not Resizable</li>
			<li>Very Slow</li>
			<li>Very Large Image</li>
			<li>Works for nearly any FS</li>
			<li>Maintains entire drive state, good for forensic evidence.</li>
